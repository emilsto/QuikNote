# QuikNote

## What is this

- quiknote is an online app for quick note taking. It allows users to create, edit, and delete notes in a fast and efficient manner.

## What is the idea?

- Idea is to make a simple and convenient tool for taking and organizing quick notes online. It aims to make note taking quick and effortless, so that user does not have to take their hands off the keyboard to write and review notes. Plan is to use # in the notes to control different kinds of actions/properties that the note can do or have. For example, using #todo would set the note type to todo and using #emailto:user@mail.co would set the note type to email and the recipient email address to "user@mail.co". This way, the user can quickly create a note and set its type and properties without having to use the mouse or touch the screen. The user can also use the mouse to create notes and set their properties, but the idea is to make it as quick and effortless as possible to use the keyboard only.

## How it works

- The App uses a combination of keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl + E) to start and stop note taking. Once the note taking is active, the user can type their note directly into the text area and hit enter to save the note. The note is then sent to the server for storage and organization. User can also use different # tags to make the note more meaningful. This allows the notes to be organized and filtered easily, so the user can find the note they need quickly. It also allows the user to categorize the notes using different tags, like #todo, #idea, #email, etc. Future plan is to integrate this with a calendar, for example user can use the #date:yyyy-mm-dd to set the note date and allow the user to see notes by date.

## Why is it useful?

- It is useful because it allows the user to take notes quickly and easily without having to switch to a separate application or navigate away from what they are currently doing. It also provides a way to easily categorize and organize notes, making it easier to find and review notes later. The ability to add tags and properties to the notes, like setting a note type or recipient email address, makes it a versatile tool for various use cases.

## Tech stack

- This is all subject to change, but the current plan is to use the following tech stack:

- React (with TypeScript)
- Firebase

## Goals of the project

The goal of quiknote is to provide a simple and convenient tool for taking and organizing notes online. It aims to make note taking quick and effortless, so that users can stay focused and productive. Also, it is a project for me to learn and practice web development.
